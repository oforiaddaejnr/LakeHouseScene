This Computer Graphics project was built on the following framework provided by my professors https://github.com/wilocw/g53gra_framework
The project was done in Visual Studio 2019, so it would be best to open it in Visual Studio 2019 or even 2017 - I'm sure it will work for this
version too. You don't have to do any extra configuation to get it to work


The scene consists of a bunch of objects created out of basic 3d shapes. Some of these objects have been animated.
You can move around the scene using the W,A,S,D or arrow keys
You can also move the camera around by pressing on the left mouse button and dragging around
You can also move the camera vertically, by using the plus and minus keys on the numeric keypad
If you press the space bar while moving around it recenters you at the starting position of the scene
The camera pans in on certain objects if you press the keys: 1,2,3, or 4
I also added a light source that moves around in the scene to simulate day and night

In the Pictures folder you can see images of the objects I built
