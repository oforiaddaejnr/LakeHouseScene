This Computer Graphics project was built on the following framework provided by my professors https://github.com/wilocw/g53gra_framework
The project was done in Visual Studio 2019, so it would be best to open it in Visual Studio 2019 or even 2017 - I'm sure it will work for this
version too. You don't have to do any extra configuation to get it to work
